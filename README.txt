This is the submission of Team Bayesian conspiracy to the Karnataka Crime Prediction Contest.

USAGE:
      python ./src/get_feats.py
      Run kcp.m script  in matlab to generate the output. The output file is "output.txt" in ./outputs
      
./competition_data - this contains the data provided on kaggle for the competition, 
                     i.e the crime-training data, the socio-economic features and
                     the id-map of the test data. 
                     
./selected_features - This folder contains the files which list the selected features for each crime.
                      feats_i.csv - selected features for crime number i
                      
./src - This folder contains the scripts required to run our model.
        scaledata.m - utility function that scales the data, making mean 0 and variance 1.
        get_feats.py - python script to generate the feature vectors for the 10 crimes using
                       the selected features in ./selected_features 
        kcp.m - this Matlab script trains the model loading the feature vectors generated by get_feats.py
                and predicts the ouptut for the test dataset.               

./feature_vectors - the script "./src/get_feats.py" generates the feature vectors into this folder.

./lib - This containg the GPML library required by our code.

./outputs - The matlab script prints the output in "output.txt" in this folder.
